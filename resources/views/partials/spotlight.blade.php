                Ken Segurie- when we see broken pieces we want to fix things. We want to make a modification of something that has fallen apart. For example, I was working on a dress today that was a 50’s knit dress. I repaired the holes with embroidery threads. You’re pretty much adding to the story of the piece as it goes through your hands. It’s an incredible feeling.

                        Leah and Maya have known each other since 6th grade and Leah and Josh are dating. They moved to LA 8 years ago, all for different reasons. 

                        “obviously we all thrifted for most of our lives. When we were younger, we used to go to a place called electric blender. We would thrift there and play dress up with our parents/grandparents clothes in the 70’s. It now makes sense that we all get together in LA. We ended up saying screw this- we want to work for ourselves”. - Leah

                        When we started the business, we were in a transitionary process. We all wanted to do something new. It was this weird period and we literally just googled bulk vintage in LA. We had about a thousand dollars in our accounts. We just threw a hail mary and it worked. First few months were challenging… we literally had to build shelves in the kitchen just to hold our stuff. 

The funny thing is we would buy the promotional camel cigarette jackets. That was literally keeping us afloat the first few months. It was all about finding that one little thing we can use to keep up the revenue.  - Joshua
